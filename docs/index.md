title: Reproducible data science techniques in actuarial work
---

**How can actuaries ensure that workflows are efficient, minimise the risk of errors and allow complex work to be reproduced by others in their organisation?**

Actuaries exploring the use of data science have the opportunity to revisit existing ways of working and consider whether they remain appropriate.  These challenges are also being faced in science and by other professions.

This presentation looks at why the concept of *reproducible work* is key and how it can help address the challenges of working in data intensive fields.

This work was originally presented at the Data Science: Opportunities for Actuaries virtual event in February 2019.
