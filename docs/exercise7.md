The final exercise demonstrates the advantages of working reproducibly.

> You have discussed the report with a colleague/manager/client.
>
> Disaster!  It has emerged that the cashflows for business lines 5 and 6 should not have been included in the analysis and the discount rate should have been 2.75% p.a.

If your workflow looked like this you would have to amend the analysis in Excel and manually update the Word document.

Manual steps such as these are time consuming and can introduce errors.  What if you had updated the discount rate in the report but forgot to do so in the spreadsheet?  Would this get caught when the work was checked?

**Working reproducibly minimises the risk of these errors and allows changes to be made efficiently.**

## Update the analysis

In order to make the required changes:

* Replace line 2 of the `munge/01-A.R` script with `cashflows_to_use = rawcashflows[2:5]` to remove the cashflows for lines 5 and 6.  Note how we never edit the raw data!
* Change line 20 in the `src/analysis.R` script to `disc = 0.0275` to change the discount rate.

## Check your changes

Before creating the report, run your tests on the changes in the console

```R
> test.project()

== Results =====================================================================
OK:       3
Failed:   5
Warnings: 0
Skipped:  0
```

There are 5 failed tests.  To review the tests run the following

```R
> (test_dir("tests", reporter = "list"))

    file context                                test nb failed skipped error warning user system real
1 test.R                  discount() works correctly  3      0   FALSE FALSE       0    0      0    0
2 test.R         Correct business lines are included  1      1   FALSE FALSE       0    0      0    0
```

You can see that the "Correct business lines are included" test has failed.  

Recall that this test checks that there are 6 sets of cashflows in the analysis.  This should now be 4.

To correct this, go to `test.R` and change line 10 to `expect_equal(ncol(cashflows_to_use), 4)`.  All tests will now pass.

## Finalise the report

Open `reports/report.Rmd` (in practice you would likely need to also update the wording) and click `Knit`.  A new [report](assets/report2.pdf) will be created with the updated results.

Note how the figures, plot and tables have all updated to reflect the new analysis.
